## Upcoming Features

PokeAlarm is still under development. However, as I'm sure many have noticed, updates have slowed down. Between school, work, and a few other big life events quickly approching, my time to work on this project has taken a drastic dive. However, I still plan to add updates and support when I can. If you are interested in helping out, please contact me via the discord channel.

## FAQ

Q. Which version of PokemonGo-Map do I need?
A. Either dev or master, both have included webhook support. This program is an extension, so we can update one without affecting the other. The master branch is more stable, so I would recommend that. 

Q. Will you be adding support for XXX?
A. Please make a request in the [NEW/UPCOMING SERVICE MEGA-THREAD](https://github.com/kvangent/PokeAlarm/issues/147).

Q. Man I wish this could do XXX!
A. Open an issue on github and fill out the appropriate issue template and we'll look into it. 

Q. I am receiving XXX error from PokemonGo-Map! What do?
A. Checkout the [PokemonGo-Map Wiki](https://github.com/PokemonGoMap/PokemonGo-Map/wiki) or the reddit thread to see if anyone has any suggestions for you.

Q. I am receiving error about JSON input from PokeAlarm?
A. If you are a Windows user, stop using notepad and start using Notepad++. Make a fresh copy of the alarms.json and remake your changes. If you aren't a Windows user (or you are already using Notepad++) check your JSON format with a JSON formatter for issues.
