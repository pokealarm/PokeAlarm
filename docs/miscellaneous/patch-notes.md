## Patch 3.6

This patch contains several breaking changes - make sure to read
carefully, back up your current configuration, and have some free time
before attempting to upgrade.

### Rules (Optional)

**New Feature** - The "Rules" feature will allow users to create rules
that dictate which filters trigger which alarms. Rules are loaded via
a file containing a json object, which has 5 sections similar to the
Filters file. Each section is a key-value pair of "rule names" to "rules".
Each rule can be described as a json object containing just two fields:
"filters" and "alarms". Each field is an array of strings corresponding to
the name of a filter or alarm from a manager. Rules cannot be loaded if
they do not match an existing filter or alarm.

Rules are evaluated by checking the listed filters one by one (in order),
until a match is found. Once a match is found, PA will them notify each alarm
listed in the Rule. **Every** rule is always evaluated **every** time.

Rules are an optional configuration setting and if no rules are set then PA
will check every filter in the order that they are listed in the filters file
and will target every alarm.

Rules can be loaded via a rules file with `-r` and `--rules` via commandline
or `rules: rules.json` in config.ini.

Each rules file must be configured key-value objects and contain at least one
or more of following rules sections:

* `monsters`
* `stops`
* `gyms`
* `eggs`
* `raids`

The inner section of each rule must be configured as a key-value object where
the key is the rule's name, and the value is the rule's setting.

Each rule can be described as follows:

```json
"example_rule" : {
    "filters": [ "filter1", "filter2" ],
    "alarms": [ "alarm1", "alarm2" ]
}
```

### Alarms

**Breaking Changes** - To fully take advantage of the "Rules" feature, the
"Alarms" feature was changed to require a key-value json object instead of
a list. Alarms should now be a list of "name" -> "alarm settings".
The alarms.json.example has been updated to match this.

#### Changed Alert Sections

The Alert sections of alarms has been updated to match the event names:

* `pokemon` -> `monsters`
* `pokestop` -> `stops`
* `gym` -> `gyms`
* `egg` -> `eggs`
* `raid` -> `raids`

#### Alerts Converter

A new tool has been added to `tools/convert_alarms_file.py`, this tool is
designed to convert Alerts files from 3.5 and prior to the 3.6 alert format.

**Usage**:

```bash
python convert_alarms_file.py /path/to/alarms.json
```

#### Telegram Changes

**Breaking Changes** - Telegram alarms have been reworked to resolve multiple
issues and address Telegram API changes.

* **Content Changes** - Telegram now uses markdown instead of html to reduce
conflicts caused by using invalid DTS fields. Existing alerts will have to be
reconfigured to make this change.
  * The `venue` field does not support markdown or html coding
  * `title` and `body` have been merged into `message` to better represent how
  the Telegram API actually treats messages. The old behavior can be mimiced
  by using the following example content: `*TITLE GOES HERE*\n BODY GOES HERE`
* **Field Changes** - The following fields have been changed:
  * `bot_token`: Can now be set at an Alert level. DTS compatible.
  * `chat_id`: Now DTS compatible.
  * `stickers` -> `sticker`: Set to "true" for sticker with message,
 set to "false" for no sticker.
  * `sticker_notify`: Whether or not sticker messages causes a notification.
  * `sticker_url`: Url to be used for the sticker. Must be .webp file.
  * `location` -> `map`: true for map after message, false for no map.
  * `map_notify`: Whether or not map messages causes a notification.
  * `venue`: Sends the map and message in a single condensed format.
  * `venue_notify`: Whether or not venue messages causes a notification.
  * `max_retries`: Max attempts to send for each message.
 (Telegram no longer uses the command line equivalent)

### Filters

* Listed filters now evaluate in the order listed in the file.
* The `"geofences" : [ "all" ]` shortcut now evaluates in the order that the
geofences are listed in the geofence file.
* `gym_name_contains` is now case-insensitive.

#### Time Based Filtering

Filters now support filtering based on event timing.  This allows for
greater control over event alerts than what was previously supported via the
`timelimit` configuration option.

* **New Filters**
  * `min_time_left` - The minimum amount of time in seconds until the event
	* `max_time_left` - The maximum amount of time in seconds until the event
* **Filter Events**
  * **Monsters** - Filters based on time until monster despawns
	* **Stops** - Filters based on time until the lure ends
	* **Raids** - Filters based on time until the raid ends
	* **Eggs** - Filters based on time until the egg hatches

### Locale

  * `size` - Changed to support locales
  * `weather` - Outputs the current weather conditions in the alert

### Server Settings

* **Performance Fixes** - Users should now see improved performance
  and less system resource usage overall.

### Bug Fixes

* **Twitter Alarms**
  * Maximum length has been extended to 280 characters to match Twitter
	 standards and settings
	* All URLs are now counted as 23 characters towards the overall
	 character limit detection. URLs that would cause the tweet to exceed
	 280 characters will be dropped from the tweet.
	* DTS is now evaluated before the length of the status update is
	 calculated. This corrects issues with improper Twitter Status Truncation
